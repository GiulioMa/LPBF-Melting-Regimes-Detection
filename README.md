# LPBF Melting Regimes Detection

## Overview

This repository contains code for detecting melting regimes in Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) using data from optical reflection and emission. The project aims to perform this task in an unsupervised way, focusing on feature extraction and data visualization.

## Features

- Data extraction from given conditions
- Calculation of statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness, etc.)
- Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis
- Data visualization
- Feature extraction 
- Clustering 

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
